# DSA Journey Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey** repository! This repository contains all the code I have written as part of my DSA learning experience, following the [CodeHelp - By Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelp) YouTube channel. I am excited to share my progress and insights as I work through various topics and problems.

## About This Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my solutions, implementations, and notes on various data structures and algorithms topics. My goal is to document my learning journey, track my progress, and create a reference guide for future study and review.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on the topics and types of problems covered. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- **Arrays:** Solutions and problems related to arrays, including searching and sorting.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementations and exercises involving singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Problems and solutions for stack and queue data structures.
- **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs:** Graph algorithms, including DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solutions to dynamic programming problems.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other interesting problems and solutions not categorized above.
## Resources

Throughout my journey, I've relied on various resources to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Here are some of the key resources I recommend:

- **YouTube Channel: [CodeHelp - By Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelp):** The primary source of learning for this repository, offering clear explanations and practical examples.
- **Books:** Some books that have been helpful include "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, and "Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy" by Narasimha Karumanchi.
- **Online Platforms:** Practice problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeChef have been instrumental in applying concepts.
