3. Void Pointers:
A void pointer is a generic pointer; it has no associated type with it. A void pointer can hold an address of any type and can be typecasted to any type. Thus we can use the void pointer to store the address of any variable.

Void pointer is declared by: 

void *ptr;
 

Note:

1. void pointers cannot be dereferenced. It can, however, be done using typecasting the void pointer.

2. Pointer arithmetic is not possible on pointers of void due to lack of concrete value and size.
